## Standard modes of operation (from the manual, removed non-applicable recirculation modes):

### I. Continuous Ventilation
This mode of operation provides continuous ventilation within the home. You may, for example, select
Continuous Ventilation at low speed for normal operation and increase to high speed during increased
activity levels, such as cooking and showering, etc.

### III. 20 Minutes On, 40 Minutes Standby 20/hr 40/hr
This mode of operation provides 20 minutes of ventilation each hour. You can use this ventilation mode at
low speed for low household activity levels or when the home is unoccupied.

### IV. 10 Minutes On, 50 Minutes Standby 10/hr 50/hr
This mode of operation provides 10 minutes of ventilation each hour. You can use this ventilation mode at
low speed for low household activity levels or when the home is unoccupied. This mode is useful when
20/40 mode is providing too much ventilation.

### VI. Continuous Low Fan Speed LO
This mode will operate the fan in low speed continuously at the selected operating mode (Ventilation or
Recirculation).

### VII. Continuous High Fan Speed HI
This mode will operate the fan in high speed continuously at the selected operating mode (Ventilation or
Recirculation). This mode is useful when occupancy in the home or activity is high for an extended period
of time

## How dehumidistat in HRV works
when the level of interior humidity is above the set point, high-speed ventilation mode is activated,
regardless of currently user-selected mode. This is effective only during the heating season,
when the outdoor temperature is below 15 deg.C. The average person is comfortable between 30% and 50% RH.

## Dry Control operation
The HRV must have a jumper in place between 2 (ON) and 3 (RED) on the terminal block when installing the unit without a main control.
Low Speed: A jumper between 2 (ON) and 1 (LOW) initiates low speed ventilation.
High Speed: A jumper between 2 (ON) and 6 (HI) initiates high speed ventilation.
Dehumidistat: A dry contact for a Dehumidistat is connected between 2 (ON) and 10 (BLK)

## Conclusion
Basically, three modes of relay-controllable operation:

 1. Low speed ventilation
 2. High speed ventilation
 3. High speed *only* IF outside air temperature is below 15 deg. C for the last 24 hours.
